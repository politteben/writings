## Unit 1 - Week 1
### Group Tutorial: 7 Objects
**A thing/object that shouldn’t exist: Travel Adapters**<br>
There is some commentary here about how the different plugs and power standards is a system that should be standardized (think about the standardization of power on the other end with things like USB-C), but beyond the larger problem these products are attempting to solve, they are cheaply made and in some cases can prove to be a fire hazard. I personally have found that for the US plug on the output side, they do not always hold very tight so if you put a larger charger on the other end it does not want to stay connected. This, along with the general overwhelming front made the product confusing in way that I personally feel doesn’t inspire confidence.<br><br>

**The most important object you own: Leatherman**<br>
I struggled with this one for a bit. Specifically because of the word “important”. Because originally I started to think more down the sentimental route, but I feel like importance implies some sense of value beyond my own opinion. I also wanted to stray away from thinking about this solely in a monetary sense. Ultimately, the train of thought I ended up on is thinking about if I am going on a trip and packing, what are some of the objects that I’m ultimately drawn to wanting to bring with me, and with that I ended up on my leatherman.<br><br>

**An object that makes you angry: Car Infotainment Systems**<br>
They’re all bad. And for a multitude of different reasons. All-screens, the desire for data/control of the content you listen to, privacy policies...<br><br>

**The most beautiful thing/object in the world: Ressense Type 3**<br>
Planetary gear box, oil, deep black hides it all<br><br>

**The most useful thing that serves a single function: Watch**<br>
Understanding time, and the passage of time, in a way that is so accessible because it’s attached to us, is one of the most valuable things in my mind. Understanding the time provides function both retrospectively and thinking and looking into the future. It is a product that acts like a starting block for us to them internalize and build off of.<br><br>

**One object that inspires you: Playdate**<br>
Developed by Panic, documentation, tools for children, not trying to be anything it’s not, fun<br><br>

**Object that best encapsulates you: Digital Camera**<br>
Technology has pushed innovation but has maintained a sense of where it came from and hasn’t forgotten what it is. Creates something. Many different functions/modes it can fall into to get to the end product, just with different priorities. It’s a bit of an aspirational product as well.
