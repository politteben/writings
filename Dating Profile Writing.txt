### Bio
Hi there, I’m Ben! I’m an industrial designer with an interest in providing thoughtful innovation in existing product categories without alienating existing users or the work that came before me. I want to design objects for those who care deeply about the product category I’m designing within, as well as encourage newcomers to become those types of people. I have a strong background in prototyping, digital fabrication, and circuit design/coding.

I have just moved to London after growing up in the United States, so a lot of my time is currently spent walking around and exploring the area. That being said I also have interests relating to tennis, F1, Apple, jazz, musicals, stationary, and mechanical keyboards.

### Previous Experience
I studied Industrial Design at Georgia Tech for my undergraduate degree. After that I worked for 3 years doing R&D work for a power tool company. My predominant role was prototyping and building demos for trade shows, but I was also heavily involved in research as well.
