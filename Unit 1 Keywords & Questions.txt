## Affordances For The Curious
The inner workings of how an object achieves it’s function should be hidden enough that someone who cares only about the end result should not have to think about it at all--to the extent that it is almost magic. But, for those who care about how the end result is achieved, there should be affordances in place that act as a starting block to understand what’s happening behind the curtain.
## Subtlety
An object should never be in your face trying to grab your attention away from something else unless absolutely necessary.
Subtlety also means there should be explicit focus on the smaller things. Things that might not make-or-break a product, but have more to say about the perceived quality and care when designing the product.
## Physicality
An object should be physical-first. You can sparingly incorporate purely-digital elements, but when someone is reflecting on an object, their mind should immediately think of the physical product.
Objects should also incorporate some sense of dynamic adaptation. Whether that be through direct manipulation or third-party factors; an object should respond to some level of “input”.
## Respect
**Respect for Materials** - Respecting the inherent advantages and disadvantages of a material and not trying to mask or misuse it.<br>
**Respect for Space** - Physical objects take up physical space. To respect this space is to not frivolously take up that space, and to occupy it with something that is of quality both in concept and execution.<br>
**Respect for The Past** - Keeping elements from what came before in the product category shows respect for the designers before me and offers some familiarity to those who have used products in the space beforehand.<br>
**Respect for Who I’m Designing For** - Understand who the stakeholders for a product are and where they rank. It is common to have an opposing opinions from different stakeholders as well as yourself. The solution is rarely to disregard the opinions of others.
## Prepared
I want to be prepared to tackle the thing in front of me at any moment. I don’t like finding myself in a situation of not knowing how or being incapable of doing something. This leads me to often think about tools or process improvements I want to incorporate into my design process. It also brings me hesitation when it comes to focusing too much time and specializing in a singular part of the design process.

# Questions
## What are the gaps in your knowledge around these keywords?
### Affordances For The Curious
- Execution beyond a window. The idea of providing a window into an object feels like usually the wrong way to approach this. I think the gap falls under just methods and practice in doing this in a way that is more evocative.
- How to do this beyond just the physical design of a product. I suspect that things like providing an easy way to disassemble, manuals, and replacement parts plays into this in some ways, but it’s not something I’ve looked too much into.
### Subtlety
- This feels like a practice thing in a lot of ways. It’s not necessarily that I have a large gap somewhere in my knowledge of how to execute this, but rather about finding the right amount. Where is the line for a product when it comes to attention? How about focusing on the small things vs. time addressing the larger problem the product is trying to solve?
	- Is it possible with more practice that I can come up with a personal framework that is product agnostic to help with this?
### Physicality
Methods of dynamic adaptation that do not involve electronics. In the past I have relied heavily on buttons, switches, motors, LEDs, etc. to provide movement and adaptation. I would like to have a better grasp on ways to provide this in purely-mechanical movements. Not every product I design should be a tech product.
### Respect
- Better understanding of material handling. Both in terms of material properties and choosing the the right material for a job, as well as material mass manufacturing.
- Design History. I ideally would like to have a better knowledge of the history of objects that I can pull from in my head.
### Prepared
- Tools and methods
	- Blender
	- Grasshopper
	- Welding
- Learning about when & how to lean on others for help and being comfortable releasing some control during the design process.

## What is it you need to know and why is it important?
This plays into the *Prepared* keyword, but what I feel like I need to know is the exact same as the gaps in my knowledge. I don’t like there being elements of things I don’t know know how to do, and feel a push to effectively be an expert in the whole design process.

That being said, here is why I find the following keywords important to me:
### Affordances For The Curious
I grew up as someone who loved to take things apart and understand how they worked. It gave me a greater appreciation for the work that was happening behind the scenes in a product. It gave me a greater appreciation for the work that went into then hiding away the internals. And in some cases it opened my new things that I could do with the product.

I hold onto those feelings very deeply, and I want to be able to provide those feelings to other with the products I work on. I want to inspire and encourage learning about something new with the products I work on.
### Subtlety
In a lot of ways we are in an attention economy. Advertisements, products, services; they’re all trying to grab your attention and hold onto it. In a lot of ways it feels very artificial, and very gross. I understand that anything I build with have to compete and engage in this war, but I don’t want to be part of the problem.

Subtlety is also important to me in the way that it provides and opportunity for someone to think more-deeply about a product. It’s tied in with *Affordances For The Curious*, as well as *Respect*, but I want to include elements that can show someone put real thought, care, and time into something. This all-of-a-sudden feels even more important than ever with the current boom of AI-based design tools.
### Respect
Respect is important to me as I believe it shows an understanding that I am not the center of the universe, nor do I inherently know better than anyone else. Knowing this helps me with not designing in a vacuum.

## How are you going to find the unknowns?
- **Greater Study of Design History** - I want to better leverage the work and knowledge of those who have done similar work before me.
	- Their approaches to solving problems with product design
	- The tools and processes they use
	- Elements or features that have become synonymous with a product category
	- Data associated with problems in a product category
- **Practice** - Short, non-complete projects that can allow me to specifically focus on some of the trade skills associated with design.
- **Research Regarding After-Purchase Product Support** - This can start as desktop research into methods that companies use to provide support for an object after the transaction. I don’t mean customer support lines, but rather the affects of providing means and methods to repair and modify their product if a user wants.
- **Researching methods, systems, or rules-of-thumb that have been developed in the past to handle things like time allocation when designing** - How can I leverage these as a building block when defining the time & resource allocation that works best for me?

## Who is being impacted by this?
This obviously changes depending on what the product I am working on is. But the through-line that I find myself naturally wanting to design for are the people who deeply care about the product category I am working within. These are generally the people with a lot of background knowledge or experience in the category. They usually have fairly strong opinions about the category as well. But on top of that they are also able to compare products within the category. To me, a coffee maker is a coffee maker is a coffee maker, but that is an absurd statement to some others. And it’s those others that I find myself naturally wanting to design for.

Adjacent to that, I also find myself wanting to encourage people to becomes these types of people if they aren’t already. This really is where *Affordances For The Curious* comes into my work.
