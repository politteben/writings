## Self Assessment and Peer Review Report
### Week 1 - 7 Objects
#### Self Assessment
I personally feel like I provided a lot of input when it came to feedback and keywords on the objects. After someone was done presenting I took a second to try and think about the larger image the objects--and how each person presented them--was painting. I then wrote down my keywords and gave them a description of each and how it related to the different objects. 
#### Peer Assessment
Ultimately everyone was engage and provided me with keywords. I wish there was more of a conversation about the words and rather a presentation followed by everyone saying their keywords, but the keywords did help me in my process of finding my 5, so the system worked.
### Week 2
Ani and I had a good conversation getting to know each other a bit more and talking about potential design opportunities. Ani was struggling to think of some so the conversation was spent mostly talking about what he could do, but I was totally cool with that as I had already started thinking through some of mine. I found his input on my ideas related to children building themselves spaces to be interested and led me down a new thinking path for that, and I hope I was able to help him with defining the general idea of accessible luxury.
### Week 3
This was a bit more informal and just involved a lot of different discussions with different people on different days thinking through design opportunities. I met with people and helped them try to think about their, and had meetings with groups just to talk about mine. Ultimately Sophia and Maxim are probably the 2 who helped me the most with defining my opportunities and Iâ€™m grateful that I was able to talk to them because I feel like my opportunities are in a much better place now because of them.
